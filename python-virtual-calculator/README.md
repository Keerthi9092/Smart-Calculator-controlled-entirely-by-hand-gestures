# Python Virtual Calculator

This project is a hand gesture-based virtual calculator that utilizes OpenCV and Mediapipe to create an interactive interface. Users can perform calculations by using hand gestures to interact with the calculator buttons displayed on the screen.

## Features

- Hand gesture recognition for user input
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Clear and evaluate expressions
- User-friendly interface with visual feedback

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Mediapipe

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using the command mentioned above.
4. Run the virtual calculator by executing the following command:
