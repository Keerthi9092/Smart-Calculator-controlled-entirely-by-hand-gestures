# Smart-Calculator-controlled-entirely-by-hand-gestures
This project demonstrates a gesture-controlled virtual calculator built using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. Instead of pressing physical buttons, users can perform basic arithmetic operations by interacting with a virtual interface using only hand gestures.

âœ¨ Highlights:

Hands-free, touchless interaction with a calculator.

Real-time hand tracking powered by computer vision.

Designed for accessibility, making interactions more intuitive.

Showcases the potential of human-computer interaction (HCI) and AI-driven interfaces.

This is a small step toward building accessible, interactive, and futuristic touchless user interfaces, reimagining how we interact with everyday digital tools.
